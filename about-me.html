      <h2>My name is Alison Mae Bonham. I was born in Houston, Texas at 24 weeks.
    I weighed just under 2 lbs. In 2008, I moved with my family to Austin, Texas,
    where I discovered my love for photography. By December of 2009,
    I had started my portrait photography business, Mae Photography,(now Alison Mae Photography). I carried my love for business and photography all the way to sunny California, where I attended Brooks Institute of Photography.
    I lived in almost every town and city down the coast from Santa Barbara to Ventura, and eventually, Los Angeles, CA, where I spent the last year living and working in freelance photography, social media marketing,
    and basically any film or commercial gig I could get my hands on.</h2>
